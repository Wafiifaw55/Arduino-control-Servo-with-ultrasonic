# Arduino-control-Servo-with-ultrasonic
In this project we have use Arduino Uno and-6-Servo motor with Ultrasonic sensor.
I have share for your two file code and schematic diagram.
the Servo motors will automatically work when Ultrasonic is detect any object in front it around 30cm destance (you can change it).
this project can use from any electronic engineer especially when he want to build Robot Arm or any project they want to use more servo the rotation angle depend on ultrasonic sensor value.
The angle of rotation is can change depend on engenieer needes by changing value of b, s, e, w, n, p, in code after undrstanding it.
I hope you are enjoy and find it easy and clear.
